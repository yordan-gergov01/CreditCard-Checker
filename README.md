# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Validator Project

This JavaScript project validates credit card numbers using the Luhn algorithm. It includes functions to:

validateCred() â€“ Validates a single credit card number.

findInvalidCards() â€“ Filters out invalid credit card numbers from a batch.

idInvalidCardCompanies() â€“ Identifies credit card companies (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover) that have issued invalid cards based on the first digit.

The goal is to simulate backend validation of card numbers and determine which companies might be responsible for faulty cards.

Test data includes valid, invalid, and mystery cards, all grouped in a single batch array.
